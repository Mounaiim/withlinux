Steps to add a page: 
    1/add an html page at pages
    2/add to the class at pages_controller.rb
    3/add a route in routes.rb
    4/then add access boutton through the navbar in application.html.erb
then will use UIgradients.com for the color and then add it to your css 
container-fluid get rid of the margin right and left 
then you can use inspect for live changes
also padding vs marging, margin is for the the whole section, padding is withing the section. 
change the text color of text in the home-callout css. defualt isblack but in css change with color: #404040
use inspect as much as you can, it shows different feature i.e it will show you specifity of css which class falls under which etc 


use padding on the home page if you want to increase or reduce the blue space. 

We install font awesome using gem 

  <!--<li><a href="/about">About</a></li> <!--html way-->-->
  <!--li><a href="/products">Products</a></li> <-------------------------------------- add to your navbar here-->    


route fixes#86 lesson: make pages transition dynamic instead of hardcoded (update to use prefixes:
use rails routes to check the routes you curently have
..... "/" to route_path
 .... "/about" to about_path or about_url to inject the entire domaine name 
 
 Lorem+tab will generate a large text. 
 
remember to add js for navbar to work
